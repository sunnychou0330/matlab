Genetic-Algorithm: now... in Matlab. 
====================================

<h3>Are you tired about not finding a good implementation for Genetic Algorithms?</h3>
<b>Stop looking for, here you got it!</b> Download it and try it! It includes a dummy example to realize how to use the framework, implementing a feature selection problem.

<h3>Do you think that something generic can be done ?</h3>
Genetic algorithms are well defined, but people code them again and again. This framework will allow you to just focus in you problem specific implementation, because <b>the well defined parts of the Genetic Algorithms are already implemented and ready to use</b>. Yes, ready to use.

<h3>How much effort do you spend in copy and paste + refactor the same stuff again and again?</h3>
<b>No more copy and paste + refactor</b>, just code your problem specific details and run inside the framework.

<h3>Congratulations!!</h3>
From now on, Genetic Algorithms are already done!!
